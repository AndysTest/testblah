Notes
=====

* Does a mine auto-reset?  I.e. if it was already hit, should it be a safe position?  
    This could be implemented in more than one way...
    Currently - it does NOT (KISS)
* No consideration given to UI.  It is as minimal as possible.
* time taken = a bit longer - more like 3.5 hours.  I love a problem, a hate an unfinished project.
